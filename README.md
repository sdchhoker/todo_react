# `angular-todo` â€” the starter for AngularJS apps

Starter for angular


### Prerequisites


You must have Node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].


### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```
Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].

### Task

Create a todo application.
Expected:
* User should be able to add a todo.
* User should be able to delete a todo.
* User should be able to mark a todo complete and uncomplete.
* Use css layout schemes.
